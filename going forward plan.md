# we have models working, and next need to generalize some routes

*curerntly have a route that sends all Students to front end as JSON

*make a react component that takes the json that route returns and displays all the students as a dropdown

*and/or

*dynamically create h1 showing each student 

*student _id would be a data attribute OR a prop

*each component has it's own student id 

*use a react loop (map)

*when student clicks on name, have alert
*if true
*send to back end id, class id run route for new attendance link, update student/class attendance array
